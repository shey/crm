## Getting started

## Application Features

### Contacts

A contact has an email address and multiple tags associated with it.

## Manual Testing

### Index action

```bash
 curl localhost:3000/contacts | jq
```

### Get Action

## Notes

1. database.yml has connection timeout settings to protect the database, ideally settings are used in a production env.

1. Using jsonapi-serializer to produce standardized JSON:API responses which are easier for FE clients to consume.

1. If I had more time, Iâ€™d integrate the hashid-rails gem to so numeric IDs aren't shared in the API responses.
