## Notes

1. database.yml has connection timeout settings to protect the database, ideally settings are used in a production env.

1. Using jsonapi-serializer to produce standardized JSON:API responses which are easier for FE clients to consume.

1. If I had more time, Iâ€™d integrate the hashid-rails gem to so numeric IDs aren't shared in the API responses.
