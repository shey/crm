## Getting started

```bash
bin/setup
```

To start the app

```

The app comes with some seed data. To plant the seeds, run:

## Application Features

### Contacts

A contact has an email address and multiple tags associated with it.

### Development Notes

1. database.yml has connection timeout settings to protect the database, ideally settings are used in a production env.

1. Using jsonapi-serializer to produce standardized JSON:API responses which are easier for FE clients to consume.

1. If I had more time, I’d integrate the hashid-rails gem to so numeric IDs aren't shared in the API responses.
