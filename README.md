The app comes with some seed data. To plant the seeds, run:

bin/rails db:seed
```

## üìù Notes

1. I spent ~30 minutes planning the architecture and approach before starting.

1. Development time was approximately 90 minutes.

1. database.yml includes connection timeout settings to protect the database‚Äîthese would ideally be tuned per environment in production.

1. Using jsonapi-serializer to produce standardized JSON:API responses that are easier for frontend clients to consume.

1. Using yabeda-rails to expose metrics for Prometheus/Grafana.

1. Metrics are exposed at /i/metrics to separate internal infrastructure endpoints from the public API.

1. Skipped `kamal` and Dockerization to simplify development.

1. Excluded frontend libraries and js entirely to stay focused. If I had the need I would use `esbuild` for asset bundling.

## If I had more time, I‚Äôd:

1. Integrate hashid-rails to avoid exposing ids in api responses.

1. Use Swagger tooling to generate API docs.
